# BT-Mini
A WIP small scale P2P file share.

## Building
### Dependencies
- You must have the boost.asio library installed at least.
- You must also have cmake, make, and a compatible c compiler
- You can install most of this like this:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev make cmake
```

### Building and running
```bash
# If you just want to build you can use the build.sh script
./build.sh

# If you want to build AND then run you can use the build_and_run.sh script
./build_run.sh
```
